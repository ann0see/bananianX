# bananianX
Here is a script, which installs GUI on bananian. It installs LightDM, LXDE and Openbox.<br>
Why have I made it? Because I thought there are many people who would like to have a graphical interface. 
<h2>How to install?</h2>
1. Download bananianX.<br>
2. Make it executable: chmod +x bananianX.sh<br>
3. Run it ./bananianX.sh
4. Wait...

Currently I havenÂ´t installed it yet, but you can install it and try it now.<br>
