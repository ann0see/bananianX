# bananianX
Here is a script, which installs GUI on bananian. It installs LightDM, LXDE and Openbox.<br>
Why have I made it? Because I thought there are many people who would like to have a graphical interface on their Banana Pi. Bananian was made for a lightweight Banana Pi, so there's no GUI. Bananian was made for servers, which usually don't need a GUI. But sometimes a GUI is useful. So I made this script. It is available in English and German. 
<h2>How to install?</h2>
1. Download bananianX or download the German version bananianXDE.sh.<br>
2. Make it executable: chmod +x bananianX.sh or chmod +x bananianXDE.sh<br>
3. Run it ./bananianX.sh or ./bananianXDE.sh
4. Wait...

BananianX is in BETA state currently. So it might not work as expected for now. Currently I havenÂ´t installed it yet, but you can install it and try it now.<br>
