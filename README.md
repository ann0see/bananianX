# BananianX
Here is a script, which installs GUI on bananian. It installs LightDM, LXDE and Openbox.<br>
Why have I made it? Because I thought there are many people who would like to have a graphical interface on their Banana Pi. Bananian was made for a lightweight Banana Pi, so there's no GUI. Bananian was made for servers, which usually don't need a GUI. But sometimes a GUI is useful. So I made this script. It is available in English.  
<h2>How to install?</h2>
1. Update: apt-get update
2. Download git: apt-get install -y git
2. Download bananianX: git clone https://github.com/jonisc/bananianX.git<br>
2. Change directory: cd bananianX
2. Make it executable: chmod +x bananianX.sh<br>
3. Run it ./bananianX.sh
4. Wait...
<br>
BananianX is in BETA state currently. So it might not work as expected for now. Currently I havenÂ´t installed it yet, but you can install it and try it now.<br>
