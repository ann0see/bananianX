  "body": "### Welcome to BananianX\r\n<p>I have created a Skript, which installs GUI on the Banana Pi. Bananian was made for the Banana Pi as Server, so you don´t really need a GUI. But some people would like to have a GUI, so I have made this Skript. It is available in English and German. Currently it is in BETA state, and there may be issues. Please tell me. </p>\r\n### README\r\nHere is a script, which installs GUI on bananian. It installs LightDM, LXDE and Openbox.<br>\r\nWhy have I made it? Because I thought there are many people who would like to have a graphical interface on their Banana Pi. Bananian was made for a lightweight Banana Pi, so there's no GUI. Bananian was made for servers, which usually don't need a GUI. But sometimes a GUI is useful (there are People who don´tlike the terminal) So I made this script. It is available in English and German, but feel free to translate it into your language. (See the Repo, go into the folder Other language and translate the bananianXTranslate.sh into your language eg French: bananianXFR.sh you can commit it or you can mail me: bananianx@t-online.de I have translated BananianX into my native language german.\r\n<h2>How to install?</h2>\r\n1. Download bananianX or download the German version bananianXDE.sh.<br>\r\n2. Make it executable: chmod +x bananianX.sh or chmod +x bananianXDE.sh<br>\r\n3. Run it ./bananianX.sh or ./bananianXDE.sh\r\n4. Wait...\r\n\r\nBananianX is in BETA state currently. So it might not work as expected for now. Currently I haven´t installed it yet, but you can install it and try it now.<br>\r\n#Contact\r\nYou can contact me with this form: [Contact](https://goo.gl/forms/qAs64z4lgxsgUxVp2)\r\n",
