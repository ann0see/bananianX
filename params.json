  "body": "### Welcome to BananianX\r\n<p>I have created a Skript, which installs GUI on the Banana Pi. Bananian was made for the Banana Pi as Server, so you don´t really need a GUI. But some people would like to have a GUI, so I have made this Skript. It is available in English. Currently it is in BETA state, and there may be issues. Please tell me. </p>\r\n### Versions\r\nThere are 2 Versions of BananianX. BananianX FULL and BananianX LIGHT.\r\n1. BananianX LIGHT: Installs only the most important packets. Doesn´t take as long to install as BananianX FULL. Uses less disk space.\r\n1. BananianX FULL: Installs more features, installation takes longer more disk space used. If there are missing packets, please contact me. See the contact options.\r\n### README\r\nHere is a script, which installs GUI on bananian. It installs LightDM, LXDE and Openbox.<br>\r\nWhy have I made it? Because I thought there are many people who would like to have a graphical interface on their Banana Pi. Bananian was made for a lightweight Banana Pi, so there's no GUI. Bananian was made for servers, which usually don't need a GUI. But sometimes a GUI is useful (there are People who don´t like the terminal) So I made this script.\r\n\r\n<h2>How to install?</h2>\r\n1. Download bananianX<br>\r\n2. Make it executable: chmod +x bananianX.sh<br>\r\n3. Run it ./bananianX.sh\r\n4. Wait...\r\n\r\nBananianX is in BETA state currently. So it might not work as expected for now. Currently I haven´t installed it yet, but you can install it and try it now.<br>\r\n#Contact\r\nYou can contact me with this form: [Contact](https://goo.gl/forms/qAs64z4lgxsgUxVp2) or you can mail me: bananianx@t-online.de\r\n",
