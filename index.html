<p>The goal of this script is to provide an easy solution to install a graphical user interface (GUI) on Bananian (LightDM and xfce4), a special Linux Distro for the Banana Pi board. Since <a href="https://www.bananian.org/news#the_end_-_2017-04-02">Bananian has been abandoned</a> and not many people were actually interested in this project, I decided not to develop the script further. While it should work on the last version of Bananian, I discourage anybody from using it. Bananian and BananianX don't get any updates anymore and could have critical bugs including security issues.
Possibly this script still works on some Debian distros I don't know. Feel free to update and fork this repo. Please include credit if you want to release the software and contact me.

<a id="versions" class="anchor" href="#versions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Versions</h3>

<p>There are 2 Versions of BananianX. BananianX FULL and BananianX LIGHT.<br>
<ol>
<li>BananianX LIGHT: Installs only the most important packets. DoesnÂ´t take as long to install as BananianX FULL. Uses less disk space.</li>
<li>BananianX FULL: Installs more features, installation takes longer, more disk space used. If there are missing packets, please contact me. See the contact options.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>BananianX is not actively developed. So it might not work as expected.<br></p>
