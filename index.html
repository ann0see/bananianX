<a id="welcome-to-bananianx" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-bananianx" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to BananianX</h3>

<p>I have created a Skript, which installs GUI on the Banana Pi. Bananian was made for the Banana Pi as Server, so you don´t really need a GUI. But some people would like to have a GUI, so I have made this Skript. It is available in English and German. Currently it is in BETA state, and there may be issues. Please tell me. </p>

<h3>
<a id="versions" class="anchor" href="#versions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Versions</h3>

<p>There are 2 Versions of BananianX. BananianX FULL and BananianX LIGHT.
1. BananianX LIGHT: Installs only the most important packets. Doesn´t take as long to install as BananianX FULL. Uses less disk space.
2. BananianX FULL: Installs more features, installation takes longer more disk space used. If there are missing packets, please contact me. See the contact options.</p>

<a id="readme" class="anchor" href="#readme" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>README</h3>

<p>Here is a script, which installs GUI on bananian. It installs LightDM, LXDE and Openbox.<br>
Why have I made it? Because I thought there are many people who would like to have a graphical interface on their Banana Pi. Bananian was made for a lightweight Banana Pi, so there's no GUI. Bananian was made for servers, which usually don't need a GUI. But sometimes a GUI is useful (there are People who don´t like the terminal) So I made this script. It is available in English and German, but feel free to translate it into your language. (See the Repo, go into the folder Other language and translate the bananianXTranslate.sh into your language eg French: bananianXFR.sh you can commit it or you can mail me: <a href="mailto:bananianx@t-online.de">bananianx@t-online.de</a> I have translated BananianX into my native language german.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-to-install" class="anchor" href="#how-to-install" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to install?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download bananianX or download the German version bananianXDE.sh.<br>
</li>
<li>Make it executable: chmod +x bananianX.sh or chmod +x bananianXDE.sh<br>
</li>
<li>Run it ./bananianX.sh or ./bananianXDE.sh</li>

</ol>

<p>BananianX is in BETA state currently. So it might not work as expected for now. Currently I haven´t installed it yet, but you can install it and try it now.<br></p>
