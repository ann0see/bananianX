<p>I have created a Skript, which installs GUI on the Banana Pi. Bananian was made for the Banana Pi as Server, so you don´t really need a GUI. But some people would like to have a GUI, so I have made this Skript. It is available in English and German. Currently it is in BETA state, and there may be issues. Please tell me. </p>

<p>Here is a script, which installs GUI on bananian. It installs LightDM, LXDE and Openbox.<br>
Why have I made it? Because I thought there are many people who would like to have a graphical interface on their Banana Pi. Bananian was made for a lightweight Banana Pi, so there's no GUI. Bananian was made for servers, which usually don't need a GUI. But sometimes a GUI is useful. So I made this script. It is available in English and German. </p>

<h2>
<a id="how-to-install" class="anchor" href="#how-to-install" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to install?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download bananianX or download the German version bananianXDE.sh.<br>
</li>
<li>Make it executable: chmod +x bananianX.sh or chmod +x bananianXDE.sh<br>
</li>
<li>Run it ./bananianX.sh or ./bananianXDE.sh</li>
<li>Wait...</li>
</ol>

<p>BananianX is in BETA state currently. So it might not work as expected for now. Currently I haven´t installed it yet, but you can install it and try it now.<br>
